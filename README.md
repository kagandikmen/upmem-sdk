UPMEM SDK is no longer downloadable on [sdk.upmem.com](https://sdk.upmem.com/) as of 2025-11-23. This repository is therefore intended to serve as an archive for people that want to continue using it in their personal workloads.

This repository uses Git Large File Storage (LFS). Visit [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) for a nice tutorial on how to install it.

**Disclaimer:** All files in this repository were previously made publicly available by UPMEM. This archive is provided for preservation and personal use only.
